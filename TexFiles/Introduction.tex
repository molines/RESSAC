\section*{Introduction}

This report describes in details the <CONFIG_CASE> simulation performed in the frame of the DRAKKAR project. 
This run is the ORCA12 reference simulation computed at MEOM (LEGI, CNRS). The mesh is an ORCA grid 1/12\degres \enspace at equator, 
with partial-steps, 46 levels Drakkar type. 
We run twice a 32-year experiment during the 1979-2010 ERA-Interim period, forced by DFS5.1.1 Drakkar Forcing Set.
The code is based on version NEMOv3.4 (including a fix for TKE bug).

This report is organized in different sections. The first one deals with the details of the numerical code, 
the parametrizations and the forcing issues. The second section describes the model configuration, 
e.g. the model grid and the input data of the model. A third section is dedicated to the technical details 
of the production of the run and gives some informations about the computing performance. Finally, the last 
section gives some elements of validation of the run.
